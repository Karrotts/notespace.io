## What is notespace.io?
Notespace is a note taking web application that uses Markdown to create strongly formatted notes, and notebooks. The application was inspired by my love and curiosity of Markdown and my strive to learn more on how to parse data. I built a custom Markdown-to-HTML class library in C# called ConvertMarkdown (you can find it [here](asdfa)) which was the most challenging part of building this application.
