## About This Project
This application was built for the San Diego Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA) Cloud Application Development Cohort. This application was built during the 18-week program where I must build a cloud application using Azure cloud technologies. During the 18-week program I utilized the waterfall model of software development where I gathered the requirements needed for the application, designed the application, implemented and maintained the application.

For my project, I proposed to make an application that utilizes markdown to allow users to quickly make formatted notes, documentation, and public journals. The purpose of this application is to allow learners to quickly create online notes and documentation that is hosted in the cloud to provide the end user instant access to their notes wherever they are in the world.

Note taking is an important aspect of learning any kind of material, it allows you to look back at important topics or sections in which you may struggle with. Taking notes allows you to write material into your own words which helps with retaining the information you have learned. A major problem with most note taking applications is formatting the information in a clear concise manner. This application attempts to solve that by allowing users to quickly transform notes into a well formatted documents using Markdown.

This project went through multiple phases and updates during the 18-week period. You can find more information about the project, including requirements, design documents, and testing in the
